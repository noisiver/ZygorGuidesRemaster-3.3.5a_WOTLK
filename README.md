## Version

- Version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ErebusAres/ZygorGuidesRemaster-3.3.5a_WOTLK?label=Version%203.0.&color=1f6feb)
- Intended client: **WotLK 3.3.5a / 12340**

## Who This Is For

This addon is intended for:

- World of Warcraft **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)** clients
- Private server environments (for example TrinityCore-based servers)
- Players who want the classic Zygor guide experience with a cleaner UI

This project is primarily focused on **WotLK 3.3.5a**. Other clients may work, but support and testing are centered on 3.3.5a.

## What You Get

- Step-by-step leveling and quest progression guidance.
- Arrow and waypoint navigation while you play.
- Structured objective flow (accept, complete, and turn-in).
- A cleaner, more readable viewer UI designed for long play sessions.
- Includes talent guidance via the bundled `ZygorTalentAdvisor` module inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## What Stayed the Same

Core 3.3.5a-era behavior is preserved:

- Guide parser and step engine.
- Map and waypoint workflow.
- Legacy guide execution patterns.
- Base `ZygorTalentAdvisor` behavior and structure.

## What's New in the Remaster

- Cleaner, retail-inspired UI shell for both guide browsing and options.
- New standalone Guide Manager (Home / Featured / Current / Recent) with category sidebar, search, favorites, and folder-style tree behavior.
- New in-app Options experience with categorized navigation, searchable pages, and improved layout consistency.
- Remastered waypoint arrow and objective text styling updates, including clearer action/title/distance presentation and distance color gradients.
- Accessibility improvements including colorblind presets and simplified noun-color handling for better readability.
- Ongoing compatibility focus for 3.3.5a environments and expanded guide coverage where applicable.

## Included Components

1. `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` - Remastered viewer and guide runtime.
2. `ZygorTalentAdvisor` - bundled inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` and loaded as part of the addon package.

## Key Controls

- Minimap icon:
  - Left-click toggles the guide viewer.
  - Right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Shift + Right-click opens options.
- Viewer toolbar:
  - Guides left-click opens the legacy quick guide dropdown.
  - Guides right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Settings left-click opens quick settings.
  - Settings right-click opens Guide Manager options.

## Quick Install

### Installation Overview

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract to `Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enable the addon.

### Detailed Steps

1. Close World of Warcraft.
2. Open `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Remove older folders if present:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - `ZygorTalentAdvisor`
   - This avoids mixed files from older releases.
4. Copy this folder into `AddOns`:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
5. Confirm the top-level folder exists:
   - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
6. Launch the game and enable the addon.

## Common Issues

**Addon not showing in-game**

- Make sure the folder structure is:
  - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
- Do not nest folders (no double folder level).

**Out of date warning**

- Enable **Load out of date AddOns** on the character select screen.

**Guide not progressing**

- Some imported guides may not fully match 3.3.5a data.
- See the Known Issues section below.

## Update Notes

1. Install or update the `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` folder as a single addon package.
2. `/reload` is usually enough for Lua-only changes.
3. A full relaunch is safer when files, XML includes, assets, or bundled modules change.

## Guide Profiles

- Current default guide content is the remastered, TrinityCore-oriented profile for WotLK 3.3.5a private servers.
- An optional Alliance fallback profile exists at `Guides\Leveling_Original\ZygorGuidesAlliance.lua`.
- That fallback is original, unmodified classic Zygor content and should only be used if the remastered default route is problematic for a specific session.

## Localization

Localization key coverage is complete across shipped locales (`Main` + `NPCs`) with placeholder and format-consistency checks.

Current focus is community QA review:

- natural phrasing in live gameplay context,
- terminology consistency,
- official localized NPC proper names,
- encoding and readability verification.

Localization was largely AI-assisted and should be treated as needing community review until native-speaker QA confirms quality.

### Community Credits

- [`mikki33`](https://github.com/mikki33) for providing Russian localization changes and review updates.

## Support Wanted (Localization QA)

If you can validate translations in-game, your help is very welcome.

Please report:

- mistranslations,
- awkward phrasing,
- broken placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `|n`, color codes),
- incorrect NPC names,
- encoding artifacts.

## Safety and Trust

This addon is fully open source and can be inspected before use.

## Changelog

### Revision 165 - 3.0.165

- Fixed a combat-lockdown blocked action error where the floating action button bar could call protected `Hide()` paths while entering combat.
- Added missing item database records for `23478` Recruit's Pants, `23479` Recruit's Robe, `1374` Frayed Shoes, and `2650` Flimsy Chain Boots.
- Updated `ZygorItemDB.lua` metadata to `2026-05-13 09:12:38 -05:00` and `24937 Items`.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.165.

### Revision 164 - 3.0.164

- Added a small remaster compact-view spacing adjustment for 1-5 step mode so each inline step background/border has extra padding around the text.
- Increased compact step breathing room to 3px top/bottom padding and a 6px horizontal text inset without changing the full "show all steps" layout.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.164.

### Revision 163 - 3.0.163

- Added a Step Display toggle to hide the guide progress bar, including the remaster footer frame that contained it, so disabling the option removes the empty bottom container as well.
- Reworked guide travel routing so the Optimization travel toggle selects between advanced LibRover routing and the lightweight flight-path fallback.
- Re-enabled LibRover loading, added WotLK taxi data for flight-path routing, and guarded LibRover startup/abort paths for the 3.3.5a runtime.
- Improved fallback flight-path text so route waypoints preserve labels such as `Fly to River's Heart` instead of being reformatted as generic guide objective text.
- Adjusted zhCN/CJK font handling so Chinese, Taiwanese, and Korean clients use the client-provided UI font for remaster headers and guide browser text instead of bundled Latin Segoe fonts.
- Stopped forcing `Fonts\ZYKai_T.ttf` for zhCN because that exact font path is not guaranteed to exist in the addon/client environment.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.163.

### Revision 158 - 3.0.158

- Adds @hypopheria2k's PR Merge:
  - Adds more Database Items that were originally missed, including roughly 365 Items.
  - Adds Questing: Mute addon chat spam, preventing Zygor Guides from Letting you know every detail that's going on.
  - Adds Questing: Show Gold vendor prices in tooltips, disabling the Auction House GOLD guide integration in the tooltips.
  - Background opacity now hides borders on all panels.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.158.
Thanks Hypo!

### Revision 157 - 3.0.157

- Added a WotLK client guard in Gear Finder so later-client imported dungeon item IDs are skipped instead of being considered for 3.3.5a recommendations.
- Corrected additional WotLK dungeon boss fallback IDs for Nexus, Azjol-Nerub, Halls of Stone, Halls of Reflection, and Trial of the Champion result labels.
- Added a Heroic difficulty suffix to Gear Finder item rows when a recommendation comes from the heroic version of a dungeon.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.157.

## Notes

- Intended target client is **WotLK 3.3.5a (12340)**.
- It may work on other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is bundled and loaded from within `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## Known Issues

- Arrow scale/position drift:
  - On some setups, changing Waypoint Arrow Scale can shift the arrow position unexpectedly.
  - Resetting arrow position may not fully normalize the anchor in all UI/minimap addon combinations.
  - Status: deferred for now.

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or not fully aligned to 3.3.5a data.
- If a guide behaves incorrectly, disable it in `ZygorGuidesViewerRM/Guides/Autoload.xml` and report it.
